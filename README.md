A fun exercise to see if lock down in India has been effective in control of Covid19

Seeing the increasing cases of Covid19 in India, which touched almost 46k today, I was wondering if the extension of the lock down post 14th April had any significant impact. So, tried validating the same using python. A dataset of counts; some data wrangling and an exponential function to fit on the dataset is all I required. The results are below. Had the lock down not extended the count of cases would have been an whooping 120k.
